# Word Count

Write a program in C++ which accepts a filename as input and counts the frequency of all words
in the file. The program must print the top ten most frequent words and the count for each word
in descending order. When counting words, punctuation must be ignored and words that differ in
case only should be considered the same word: e.g. “Why”, “why” and "why?" should count as 3
occurrences of “why”. The file may be assumed to contain only ASCII. 

You should use a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach to developing your solution. 

You may use the internet to help if you wish. If the question is ambiguous, feel free to make
assumptions and state these in you solution. Please provide your working code, unit tests, test data and 
any instructions necessary for compiling and running your program.

Finally, we would like to know how much time you spend on the question. This information will not be
used to make any determination about you as a candidate but will be used to help us refine the
exercise as needed.
